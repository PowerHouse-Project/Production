# PowerHouse security policy

This document outlines the security measures and best practices we are implementing to protect the PowerHouse smart home application and its users' data.

## Security considerations

PowerHouse deals with sensitive user data and controls access to smart home devices, making security a top priority. We are committed to protecting user data and preventing unauthorized access to the system.

## Security measure
1. **Secure Authentication:** User authentication is handled using Firebase authentication, which provides secure token-based authentication. This prevents passwords from being stored or transmitted in plain text.
2. **Data Encryption:** All user data, including personal information, device data, and automation rules, is encrypted at rest using Firestore's built-in encryption capabilities and in transit using HTTPS. This protects the information from unauthorized disclosure or modification.
3. **Data Validation:** All user inputs are validated on both the client-side and server-side to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
